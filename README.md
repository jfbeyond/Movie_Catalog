Movie website with links to my favorite movies


Need to have/install Python:



- Need to install TMDB API Python wrapper:

Installation
tmdbsimple is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tmdbsimple.

You can install tmdbsimple using one of the following techniques.

Use pip:
pip install tmdbsimple
Download the .zip or .tar.gz file from PyPI and install it yourself
Download the source from Github and install it yourself
If you install it yourself, also install requests.

It has different classes that take care of the different possible requests that can be
made to the API. In this project, I utilized only two methods: .movies() and search().
Expanding to including other methods would complement the information offered in this website.
It can be left as an opportunity to improvement.



- Need to get an API Key from TMDB:

API Key
You will need an API key to The Movie Database to access the API. To obtain a key, follow these steps:

Register for and verify an account.
Log into your account.
Select the API section on left side of your account page.
Click on the link to generate a new API key and follow the instructions.


- Clone this repository in your local drive



- replace the API Key you got from TMDB in the media.py file:



- Open entertainment_media.py from the Python GUI (IDLE):

               This file contains the list of my favorite movies. This is the only hardcoded section

               of this repository, as I intend to show what my movies are. However, the user can update

               the list to the movies they like by simply modifying the names within 'my_favorites' array

               with the name of their favorite movies. The code will render the data from the movies and

               it will display them in the website once it is run.



               Just give it a try!!!
